# Bobina website

## About

This is the repository for the **Μπομπίνα** magazine website. **Μπομπίνα** (Pronounced Bobina) is the magazine of the [Cinema Department](https://kinimatografiko.gr) of the Students' Cultural Society Club [(P.O.F.P.A.)](https://pofpa.gr) of the [University of Athens.](https://www.uoa.gr)

The website is built on [Astro](https://astro.build/) and uses [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) as a back-end to fetch articles. For styling it uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [GliderJS](https://glidejs.com/) for the carousel.

The goals of this project are to build a website that's:

-   easy to update without any coding knowledge
-   simple to maintain and not expose any security risk if left unmaintained for a long time
-   extremely fast to load and great for SEO
-   extremely cheap to run and scalable
-   collect usage data while also being respecting of user's privacy.

Stack choices were made on the above principles and should adhere to them in the future.
